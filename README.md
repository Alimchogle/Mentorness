# Mentorness Data Analyst Virtual Internship
# overview
This repository contains the three main tasks I completed during my Mentorness Data Analyst Internship. Each task involved different data analysis techniques and tools, helping me to gain a diverse set of skills. Below are the details of each task:
# 1) Reel Task on SQL or Power BI
Topic: RollBack Transaction
Description: Rolls back an explicit or implicit transaction to the beginning of the transaction, or to a savepoint inside the transaction. You can use ROLLBACK TRANSACTION to erase all data modifications made from the start of the transaction or to a savepoint
# 2)Hotel Reservation Analysis with SQL
Description: The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and provide a better guest experience. In
this internship, you will work with a hotel reservation dataset to gain insights into guest preferences,
booking trends, and other key factors that impact the hotel's operations. You will use SQL to query and
analyze the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.
# 3) Songs Analysis with Power BI/Tableau
project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of YouTube songs data using Power BI.
The dataset contains key attributes such as video ID, channel title, title, description, tags, published date,
view count, like count, favorite count, comment count, video duration, video definition, and caption
details. The goal is to utilize Power BI to create insightful visualizations and reports that provide a deeper
understanding of YouTube songs' performance, popularity, and user engagement. The analysis aims to
uncover trends, preferences, and patterns in the data to aid content creators and stakeholders in
optimizing their YouTube song content.
